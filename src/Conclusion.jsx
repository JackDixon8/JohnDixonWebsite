						Rating my experiance with Nose.js and React I would defenitly rate it highly. Both are quite easy to use because of the sheer large amount of resources avaliable to help troubleshoot any problem you may have. The curve of learning these frameworks may be a little higher than other frameworks but it is more than worth it as I found this project much easier than I thought it would be once I got the ball rolling.
						<br />
						<br />
						The frameworks preformed better than I thought. Using npm commands to install all the dependancies and deploy my code was such an easy and satisfying process. This project is the first time ive really worked with frameworks so my expectations were low as I thought the learning curve would be steeper than it was.
						<br />
						<br />
						The install and configuring of the frameworks was very simple.

						<br />
						<br />
						It was very easy to make pages with, all you have to do is export them and add them to App.jsx. Having a navigation Bar is also very helpful as I can just use the aref of each page.
						<br />
						<br />
						Compared to html and css the learning curve was much higher as I find html and css are quite straightforward. But compared to a scripting language like PHP React.js is so much easier to worth with and built much smoother. The curve was not nearly as bad.

						<br />
						<br />

						In Retrospect I would not have done anything different when it comes to the choice of my frameworks. I just wish I had given myself more time so I could build something more interesting instead of making a cool looking basic website with a clock. I would have liked to make a game or something interactive with more time.
